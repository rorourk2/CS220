## Contributions

In this subsection, write one to two brief paragraphs for each team member describing their contributions to the project. You may find the following resources useful:

- **Insights | Contributors** produces a list of who contributed to the project both by number of commits and lines of code. _Insights_ also has other useful statistics about your project and is worth exploring.
- You can check **Blame** for a particular file by selecting it from the repository and clicking the _Blame_ button. This log lists who is responsible for each line of code at the current state of the repository.
- You can check the **History** for a particular file by selecting it from the repository and clicking the _History_ button. This lists the current file as well as each commit against it showing lines changed. This may reveal who did earlier work on a file that **Blame** can't, especially if someone did most of the work, but another did a quick bug fix.

Regardless of how you produce these paragraphs, it is necessary to use good hygiene with the repository. Make commits small: each sub-task completed should be a commit unto itself. Do not do one monolithic file upload just before submission.

Ryan O'Rourke worked on the write_txt, write_bin, enroll_student, remove_student, add_course, remove course, delete_all, list_students, and list_courses functions

Michael Quinn worked on the read_text and read_binary functions

## Tasks

- [ ] **Read and understand the instructions** in [instructions.pdf](instructions.pdf).
- [ ] Complete the Makefile to produce `libparser.so`, `driver`, and any other targets necessary to your project. You will be graded on this Makefile.
- [ ] Create and complete `parser.c` such that it implements all functions declared in `parser.h`.
- [ ] Build `libparser.so` and verify that when used with `driver` it produces outputs identical to when `libparser.a` is used with `static-driver`.
- [ ] Complete the **Team** and **Contributions** subsection in this README.
